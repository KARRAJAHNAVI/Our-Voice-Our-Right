# Our-Voice-Our-Right
“Our Voice, Our Rights” is a web app that visualizes MGNREGA district performance for citizens, showing current job completion, historical trends, and district rankings. It features state/district selection, charts, and geolocation, with a low-literacy-friendly UI and ready API integration.
The project “Our Voice, Our Rights” is a web application designed to make the performance data of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) program accessible and understandable for all citizens, including those with low literacy levels. MGNREGA is one of the largest social welfare schemes in the world, providing employment opportunities to millions of rural Indians every year. Despite the availability of official data through the data.gov.in API, it is not easily interpretable by the general public. This project bridges that gap by presenting district-level performance in a user-friendly and visually intuitive format.

The application allows users to select their state and district, after which it fetches performance metrics from the official MGNREGA API. These metrics include current job completion percentage, historical performance over the last five months, and district rankings. The data is displayed using interactive line charts via Chart.js, along with clear numerical indicators for current performance and rank. For added convenience, a geolocation feature has been integrated, enabling users to automatically detect their district based on their location.
The design prioritizes accessibility for low-literacy users by using simple labels, large dropdowns, intuitive buttons, and color-coded charts, ensuring that users can quickly grasp the performance data without requiring technical knowledge. The interface is fully responsive, allowing seamless use on both mobile devices and desktops.

Technically, the project is built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6), with Chart.js for data visualization and the Fetch API for real-time data integration. The structure is scalable and ready for production, with the ability to handle large-scale usage across multiple districts and states. Although the current demonstration uses sample data for stability during the presentation, the system is fully capable of fetching live data from the data.gov.in API using a secure API key.

In conclusion, “Our Voice, Our Rights” empowers citizens to monitor the performance of MGNREGA in their districts, promotes transparency, and encourages informed civic engagement by presenting complex government data in a simple, visual, and actionable manner.
